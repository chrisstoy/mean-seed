# mean-seed
Seed project for creating new MEAN apps using Express, Typescript, Angular, and WebPack

The goal is to quickly get up and running with a MEAN app that can be deployed to Heroku or any other hosting service as quickly as possible.

''NOTE'' This is a work in progress, so don't expect it to function right out of the box!

## Server
The Express server exists in the 'server' folder and uses WebPack to build itself

## Client
Example Client that runs on the server and accesses Server resources.  In this example we use Angular2 and WebPack to build.
